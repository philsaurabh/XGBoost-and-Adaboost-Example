# XGBoost-and-Adaboost-Example
A simple example project on XGBoost and Adaboost.
In this python notebook, I tried to do model fitting with some visualization and some basic data recognization techniques application like info, describe, head and tail. At last I went through the calculation of multiple performance metrics and some visualization. It is done on an open source data, but I am attaching it here for everyone's comfort.
